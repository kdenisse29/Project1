        My name is Kelly Perez, and I am 19 years old.  I was born in Morelia, Mich. That is a state in Mexico. I moved here when I was almost 10 years old, knowing no english and had only been here once for vacations. It was scary at first, creating basically a new life, but it was definitely worth it!
