  <p> I have been running since my junior year of highschool, when I did my first half marathon with CARA students, it was then that the program closed and SRC(Students Run Chicago) came to be. I actually ran with the people who created SRC and was invited to continue running with them and proceed to run a marathon. At first I was very scared.... because its a MARATHON!</p>
  <p>Later that year when I was back in school, I decided to join the track team and went on to feel amazing during EVERY run.. even the long ones! so I decided that would be the year (2016) I would run it.</p>
  <p> Since then I have ran many 5/10k's and 4 half marathons, and only 2 marathons. </p>
  <p> I am sad I will not be running this year but for the first time ever I will get to see the marathon runners from the volunteers side and I wish every runner the best!</p>
